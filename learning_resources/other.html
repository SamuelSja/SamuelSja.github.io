        <h2>VSCode</h2>
        <div class="sbox">
            VSCode is the IDE I use. It is not the only IDE, and it is probably not the best, but it is free, and it does its job.
            <div><a id="VSCodeDownload" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSCode Download</a></div>
            <div><a id="VSCodeDocs" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started" target="_blank">VSCode Docs</a></div>
            I have also become a fan of the Vim extension, but I think it best to get practice with VSCode without the Vim extension first.

        <h2>LeetCode</h2>
        <div class="sbox">
            LeetCode is a website with DSA practice problems
            <div><a id="LeetCode" href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a></div>
            <div><a id="LeetRooms" href="https://github.com/marwanhawari/LeetRooms" target="_blank">LeetRooms GitRepo</a> - LeetRooms is a Edge (and probably Google) extension that allows people to do LeetCode competitions with one another.</div>
